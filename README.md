# Javascript-Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting
Welcome to the JavaScript Intermediate Algorithm Scripting repository! This repository serves as a collection of intermediate-level algorithmic challenges and solutions using JavaScript. Feel free to use this repository to track and showcase your progress as you work through these challenges.

The JavaScript Intermediate Algorithm Scripting repository is designed to help you improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills using JavaScript. The challenges included in this repository are suitable for individuals who have a basic understanding of JavaScript and are ready to tackle more complex algorithmic problems.

# Getting Started
To get started with the JavaScript Intermediate Algorithm Scripting repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-intermediate-algorithms.git
Navigate to the repository: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project's directory:

bash
Copy code
cd javascript-intermediate-algorithms
Install dependencies (if any): Some challenges may require additional dependencies or libraries. If any dependencies are needed, follow the instructions provided within the challenge's folder to install them.

# Start solving challenges: 
Open the challenge folders located in the challenges directory and start working on solving them. Each challenge folder contains a description of the problem, example test cases, and a file where you can write your solution.

# Test your solutions:
After completing your solution, use test cases provided in the challenge folder to verify that your implementation works correctly.

# Submit your solution:
Once you're satisfied with your solution, create a new file in the challenge folder with your GitHub username as the filename (e.g., your-username.js). Copy and paste your solution code into this file and save it.

The README.md file is where you can track your progress by updating the completed challenges section.
