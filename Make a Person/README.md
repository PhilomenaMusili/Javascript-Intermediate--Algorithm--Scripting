# Person

The `Person` function creates a person object with methods to get and set the first name, last name, and full name.

## Usage

```javascript
const bob = new Person("Bob Ross");
console.log(bob.getFullName());

Example
const bob = new Person("Bob Ross");
console.log(bob.getFullName());
Output:
Bob Ross
In this example, a Person object named bob is created with the full name "Bob Ross". The getFullName method is used to retrieve the full name, which is then logged to the console.

Methods
getFirstName(): Returns the first name of the person.
getLastName(): Returns the last name of the person.
getFullName(): Returns the full name of the person.
setFirstName(name): Sets the first name of the person.
setLastName(name): Sets the last name of the person.
setFullName(name): Sets the full name of the person.
